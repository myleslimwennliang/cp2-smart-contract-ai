📄 Smart Contract AI

Final Year Project (FYP)

An AI-powered contract review system that allows users to upload legal contracts, store them persistently, generate simple summaries, and ask natural language questions about specific contracts through an interactive web interface.

This project focuses on making contract understanding accessible to non-legal users using large language models.

🎓 Project Overview
